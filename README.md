Links and things to try

## Demos 
Codepen is a website where you can try out bits of code without having to build a whole website

* My demonstration site: https://codepen.io/stringyland/pen/PrwdzQ Try changing the text and colours.
* Chill the Lion: https://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/YXxmYR 
* A secret message: https://codepen.io/mandymichael/pen/ZvJWeZ

## Look at code on sites you like
* Go to a website you like
* Click the F12 key (you might need to hold down the function key to make it work)
* Click the Inspector tab

## Try some accessibility features
* Go to [this news website](https://thewest.com.au/) and try to navigate the page using only the keyboard, no mouse or trackpad.
* Find the Zoom setting in your browser and enlarge a website to at least 200%. Is the website easier to read, or more difficult?
* Check the settings of a computer, tablet, phone or games console. Do they have any ways to make things easier for people with disabilities?
* Are there other people who do not have a disability but might like to use assistive technology sometimes?
